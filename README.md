# The Urban Toolkit (UTK)

While cities around the world are looking for smart ways to channel new advances in data collection, management, and
analysis to address their day-to-day problems, the complex nature of urban issues and the overwhelming amount of available structured
and unstructured data have posed significant challenges in translating these efforts into actionable insights. In our paper **The Urban Toolkit: A Grammar-based Framework for
Urban Visual Analytics**, we present the Urban Toolkit, a flexible and extensible visualization framework that enables the easy authoring of web-based visualizations
through a new high-level grammar specifically built with common urban use cases in mind. In order to facilitate the integration and
visualization of different urban data, we also propose the concept of knots to merge thematic and physical urban layers. This repository presents the source
code of the framework as well as documentation containing a gallery of examples, an in-depth description of the grammar and the steps needed to run the code.
