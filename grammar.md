### Condition block

The user can define a condition block inside almost any field in the grammar specification. The interpreter will replace the block with the end-result of the conditionals.

Example:  

```js
knots: [
    {
        condition: [
            {test: "zoom < 5.0", value: "wrfToSurface_d03_2016-07-01_t0"},
            {value: "wrfToSurface_d02_2016-07-01_t0"}
        ]
    }, 
    "buildings"
]
```

Variables available in the *test* field:
- *zoom*: stores the current zoom level of the visualization
- *timeElapsed*: stores the time, in milliseconds, elapsed since the last time the grammar was validated

The *timeElapsed* variable can be used to compose animations:
```js
knots: [
    {
        condition: [
            {test: "(timeElapsed/1000)%5 <= 1", value: "frame1"},
            {test: "(timeElapsed/1000)%5 <= 2", value: "frame2"},
            {test: "(timeElapsed/1000)%5 <= 3", value: "frame3"},
            {test: "(timeElapsed/1000)%5 <= 4", value: "frame4"},
            {test: "(timeElapsed/1000)%5 <= 5", value: "frame5"}
            {value: "defaultFrame"}
        ]
    }, 
    "buildings"
]
```
The example above is an animation that loop through all frames every 5 seconds.
